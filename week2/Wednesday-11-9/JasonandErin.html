      <h2>Quick bite Katana-Ya</h2>
      <p>It’s been awhile since Erin and I updated our site, and we thought creating quick posts about meals we’ve eaten would be a great way to breathe new life into the site.</p>

      <p>This week we’re visiting San Francisco while I attend Google I/O. We were both hungry and wanted to get something simple and warm on a damp, cool May day. After some Google searching, Erin found Katana-Ya ramen in the Union Square neighborhood, which was near our hotel.</p>

      <p>
      I had the Katana-Ya Ramen in Soy Broth. It included two pieces of BBQ pork, seaweed, green onions, corn, a hard-boiled egg, 2 pieces of fried goyza, and 2 pieces of karaage (fried chicken).</p>

      <p class="mono"><strong><span>By Robin Rendle</span></strong></p>
      <p>Let's take a look at some things I learned about positioning elements within SVG
        that I discovered whilst making a (seemingly) simple bar chart earlier this week.</p>
      <p>You don't have much choice but to position things in SVG. SVG is a declarative graphics format,

        There are plenty of gotchas and potentially frustrating situations though, so
        let's get down to it.</p>

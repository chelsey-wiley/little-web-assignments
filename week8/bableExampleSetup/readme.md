NPM in the root directory

create folder in client called JS

create js file inside client JS folder for ES6

use iife in JS file

step by step https://online.theironyard.com/paths/627/units/4178/lessons/19732

npm install babel-cli --save-dev (saved in development because the SCSS transpiles to CSS to it's able to be read by the browser)

the transplier documentation will tell me globally vs locally

"build": "babel client/js -d public --watch --source-maps",
the - d for destination

must have bable process running when writing in the JS bable file.

type in the scr which is the client.

JS forEach and vs for
people.forEach(function(name){
  var li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = name;

  peopleList.appendChild (li);
}
});
// for (var i=0; i < people.length; i++){
//   var name = people[i];

//   var li = document.createElement('li');
//   li.textContent = name;
//
//   peopleList.appendChild (li);
// }


arro function
peopleList.addEventListener('click', ( )=>){

}

bable rc must be in root so it can configure everything
